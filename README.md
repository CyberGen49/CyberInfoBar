# CyberInfoBar (Beta)
 A macOS-esque information bar rich with tons of features:
 * Dynamic folder-based menus that allow quick access to the apps you use most
 * Various status indicators including music and battery
 * An in-depth system menu
 * Extremel;y robost customization with a user theming system
 * Decentralized user files that are kept safe when updating the skin
 
 This suite is still in development, which means things will be broken and janky. If you find any bugs or want to make a feature request, use the Issues tab. 
 
 Although you could download the most up to date skin files and use them directly, I'd urge you to download a packaged release from the Releases tab. They're not only safer, but you'll be installing a state of the skin that I can garuntee works.
